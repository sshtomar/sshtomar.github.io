title: "The Engineer Who Writes"

"The additive effect of being good at two things is more than double," Andreessen says. "The additive effect of being good at three things is more than triple. You become a super relevant specialist in the combination of the domains."

We like clear boundries. In school we had subjects. Real world, however, is messy. The most interesting problems live at the boundaries. Innovation happens in the interstices. 
Engineers wrote code. Product managers wrote specs. Designers drew screens. Everyone stayed in their lane, attended their standups, handed off their artifacts. The system worked because the tools were hard. Specialization was efficient.

That world is ending.

Every engineer now believes they can be a PM and a designer—because with AI, they can prototype entire products in an afternoon. Every PM thinks they can code and design—because they can. Every designer knows they can do both other jobs too.

## The Old Career Path Is Dead

The traditional path was linear: junior engineer, senior engineer, staff engineer, principal engineer. Or: APM, PM, senior PM, director of product. Climb the ladder in your lane.

That ladder is now horizontal.

The most valuable people I know are hard to title. They're engineers who can run customer discovery calls. Product managers who can read a codebase and spot architectural risk. Designers who can write SQL and ship experiments.

## What This Means Practically

If you're an engineer: learn to write. Not just code comments—actual prose. Write about technical decisions. Write about product tradeoffs. Write about what you're learning. Writing forces clarity.

If you're a PM: learn to read code. You don't need to ship production features. You need to understand what's possible, what's expensive, and what's being oversimplified. Technical literacy changes the questions you ask.

If you're a designer: learn to prototype beyond Figma. The gap between mockup and working software is where ideas die. Close that gap yourself, and you control the outcome.

## Fighting slop

You still have to do the work. You still need to understand what makes a good design. You need to understand systems design. 
For a hands-on developer, reading and critically evaluating code have become more important than learning syntax and typing it out line by line. Of course, that is still an important skill, because the ability to read code effectively comes from that in the first place. But, the daily software development workflows have flipped over completely.
We'll be outsourcing tasks to AI and that frees up time to you to think and make better decisions.
