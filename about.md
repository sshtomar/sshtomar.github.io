# About

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer and Consultant. Currently, I'm working on a project to help a large Swedish Mining and Drilling equipment manufacturer build RAG applications.

In the past, I have worked in EdTech with companies like Coursera and Udacity.

This blog is a collection of my thoughts on Machine Learning, Software Engineering, and Product Management and life in general.
